# mn rigging pipeline
---
Work in progress repository for my rigging pipeline inspired by the pipeline at Trixter, the goal will be to make this work intuitively with an artist friendly UI while keeping it easily extendable by adding rig modules, would be cool to add support for multiple dcc's as well.
Project has been put on the back burner, will continue to work on this when I have some free time.
